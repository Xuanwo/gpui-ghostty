# Agent Instructions (Read First)

## Non-Negotiable Requirements

1. Create `ROADMAP.md` based on the provided input document.
2. Continuously track progress by updating `ROADMAP.md` until all scoped tasks in `ROADMAP.md` are completed.
3. Do not ask the user any questions. Keep going until `ROADMAP.md` is fully completed.
4. Work on the `main` branch. You may create git commits whenever necessary.

## Working Principles

- Keep scope tight: implement only what is explicitly required for the current `ROADMAP.md` scope.
- Prefer small, reviewable patches.
- Provide clear verification steps (commands + expected outcomes).
- Do not claim to have executed commands unless the execution is visible in the tool logs.

## Language Rules

- Discussion, reasoning, and summaries: Simplified Chinese.
- All code, identifiers, comments, and Markdown documents: English only.
